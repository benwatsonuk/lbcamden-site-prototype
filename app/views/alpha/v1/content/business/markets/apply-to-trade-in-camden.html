    <p><strong>COVID-19 update from Thursday 27 January 2022</strong></p>

    <p>England returned to Plan A measures following the huge success of the vaccination programme and falling
        Omicron infections. All measures under Plan B have been lifted meaning: </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>mandatory COVID-19 certification will end, but venues may choose to use the NHS COVID Pass
                voluntarily;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>face coverings will not be required by law in indoor venues;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>local directors of public health are still able to recommend face coverings in communal areas
                only in education settings within their area, but only where the department and public health
                experts judge the measures to be proportionate – this is a temporary measure;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>infection prevention control guidance continues to require face coverings to be worn in health
                and care settings, including primary care and pharmacies;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>it is suggested that people wear face coverings in crowded and enclosed spaces where they might
                come into contact with people they do not normally meet;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>it is still a legal requirement for those with COVID-19 to self-isolate for 10 days with the
                option to end self-isolation after 5 full days following 2 negative LFD tests.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>It is essential that businesses continue to operate in a responsible and COVID-19 secure way.</p>

    <p>Traders should have reviewed and implemented the Government’s guidance on minimising the risks and
        operating safely.</p>

<h2>Markets to operate as business as usual:</h2>

<p>During the pandemic we kept all permanent street trading licences suspended and temporary regeneration
    fees were applied to all traders in Camden, to support traders in their return to trade. This approach
    allowed flexibility of in paying a reduced fee only for the days that traders wished to trade and allowing
    for different days/markets/commodities to be tested.<br> <br> In the line with the Government's
    decision to ease of the restrictions across different work streams, we have agreed to remove
    the social distancing measures from our markets<strong> </strong>to accommodate traders steadily
    returning to trade. Pitch allocations are being reviewed to ensure that permanent licensees can trade
    from their licensed pitches. </p>

<p>All traders must carry on with ‘hands, face, space’ and comply with the COVID-secure measures in all
    markets and trading locations.</p>

<p>We will continue to monitor the updating Government guidance. Please visit the <a

            class="link-external">current guidance that covers open air markets</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Risk assessments:</h2>

<p>All traders planning to resume trade will be required to undertake a risk assessment to ensure they are
    operating as a COVID-19 secure business. This is to protect both staff and customers from infection, or the
    potential spread of infection from asymptomatic people. <br> <br>
