<p>The easiest way to stop noise can be to speak to the person causing it. They may not
    be aware that they are disrupting other people.</p>

<p>If there is a threat of violence or harassment, call the police on 999.</p>

<p>To investigate issues, the council runs a response service to witness noise at the following times:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Monday – Friday day: 9am – 5pm&nbsp;<br> Monday – Thursday night: 6pm - 2am<br> Friday night: 9.00pm –
    4.30am&nbsp;<br>
    Saturday: 1.00pm – 4:30am&nbsp;<br> Sunday: 10:30am – 2:00am</p>

<p>(you will need to log in, or create a Camden Account)</p>

<h2>What will happen next</h2>

<p>If the noise is not currently happening, or is happening outside our&nbsp;response hours, we will contact you
    within 5 days to advise.</p>

<p>If the noise is happening during our response hours, we aim to return your call within an hour to confirm
    that the noise is still on. We will need to carry out an assessment from inside your property.</p>

<p>We can’t attend the site if you do not answer our call.</p>

<p>Depending on the evidence gathered during our assessment - and if it is safe - we may approach your neighbour
    to resolve the problem.</p>

<p>If follow-up action is required, the noise and pollution team will contact you within 5 days.</p>

<p>Your details will be kept confidential.</p>
