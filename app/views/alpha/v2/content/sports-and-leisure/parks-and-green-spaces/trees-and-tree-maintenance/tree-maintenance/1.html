<h2>Inspections and maintenance</h2>

<p>Trees are inspected every 3 years, between February and October. This includes trees
  in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the street</li>
  <li>communal areas on housing estates</li>
  <li>street properties</li>
  <li>schools</li>
  <li>parks</li>
  <li>other council properties</li>

<p>Trees are inspected by a tree officer who will decide whether tree work is necessary. During the 2022-23
  financial year we are inspecting street and housing estate trees mainly in the wards of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bloomsbury</li>
  <li>Camden Square</li>
  <li>Camden Town</li>

<h3>Tree pruning</h3>

<p>General tree pruning works take place any time of year. We do not prune trees for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>light reasons</li>
  <li>droppings such as leaves, fruit or bird droppings</li>
  <li>being perceived as too large or overgrown</li>
  <li>allergies</li>
  <li>lifting of pavement or kerbs - engineering solutions will be sought for this</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#">Contact the Trees team</a> if you want to discuss pruning of a tree in a public space</p>

<h3>Crown re-reduction works</h3>

<p>Crown re-reduction works is the regular removal of branches and stems to maintain a smaller height and spread of
  a tree. This is carried out on a two or three year cycle depending on location and condition of the tree. Works
  are normally carried out between September and April depending on the weather.</p>

<p>The main reasons we carry out re-reduction works are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tree related subsidence</li>
  <li>trees damaged by high winds or vehicle strikes</li>
  <li>structural weaknesses in the tree</li>
  <li>containing tree size for management reasons</li>
  <li>tree root severance</li>
  <li>veteran tree management</li>
</ul>
