<h1>Commemorative Trees</h1>

<p>You can request to plant commemorative trees on Council-owned land including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>parks and&nbsp;open spaces</li>
  <li>housing estates</li>
</ul>

<p>Sites are very limited in parks, so we may not have space in the park you choose.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We can no longer allow commemorative plaques next to trees because of problems with vandalism and maintenance. You’re
  not allowed to place cremated remains of the deceased in or around the tree pit.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Costs</h3>

<p>The cost for commemorative planting is usually (tree species dependent):&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>£574.00 for the tree, planting and three years watering and maintenance + VAT &nbsp;</li>
  <li>£608.98 for an administration fee &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>We will confirm total cost in writing or by phone.</p>
