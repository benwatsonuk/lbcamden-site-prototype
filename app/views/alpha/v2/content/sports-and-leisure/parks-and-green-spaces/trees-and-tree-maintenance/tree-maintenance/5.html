<h2>Planting and Watering</h2>

<p>We aim to increase our number of trees by funding the planting of at least 400 trees per year. Most are replacements
  for trees removed following our cyclical inspections, but we also seek out new planting locations across the borough.
  Planting runs from October to March and covers all council owned land.</p>

<p>To propose a new planting location, contact us before September for planting in the current planting season.
  Selection of tree species is based on our aims to increase the diversity of our tree stock and to plant the largest
  appropriate tree for the location.&nbsp;</p>

    Tree Planting Strategy 2020-2025</a>.</p>

<h3>Tree pit replanting&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The list of tree pits to be replanted is compiled annually and runs from October to September the following year.
  When a tree is removed, a vacant pit is noted on our database.</p>

<p>Current vacant pits can be found on the Trees in Camden map.</p>

<h3>Young tree maintenance and watering</h3>

<p>After planting, trees have three seasons of young tree maintenance. This includes weeding, adjustment or removal of
  stakes and watering. Trees are watered from May to September every two weeks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We encourage everyone to help us water all newly planted trees in the borough to help them establish in their new
  home. To help water, please use the irrigation bag and pour water into the hole on the bag above the new “help water
  me” sticker. The bag will slowly release the water into the soil over 3-6 hours.&nbsp; Share your watering by using
  #camdentreesneedyou on Twitter.</p>

<h3>High Speed 2 replacement tree planting &nbsp;</h3>

<p>High Speed 2 (HS2) expects to remove 504 trees for construction of the new railway. HS2 will fund the replacement of
  all trees lost. &nbsp;We will plant 35 trees in winter 2018/19. All council-owned land is being considered for
  planting, including housing, parks and street tree sites. HS2 is responsible for planting around 350 trees on the land
  it owns. We’ll work with HS2 to ensure its replacement trees are the right size and type for their locations. HS2 set
  up a panel to review and challenge the removal of trees by HS2 contractors. The panel has representatives from the
  Council and community.</p>
