<h2>Tree removal</h2>


<p>We only remove trees if they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>dead or dying</li>
  <li>dangerous</li>
  <li>involved in tree related subsidence claims, but only as a last resort</li>
</ul>

<p>See our <a href="/documents/20142/5268201/Camden+trees+policy.pdf/ac911622-85ff-1d4c-a622-53e7ae71bcc2">tree
    policy</a> for more information.</p>

<p>A notice is normally placed on the tree approximately 10 days before the removal work is carried out. &nbsp;Our
  tree contractor deals with tree and stump removal separately due to the types of equipment used. Stumps are normally
  removed within 3&nbsp;months and the tree pit is left ready for replanting.</p>

<p>We plant new trees for the majority of trees removed. In some cases the sites are unsuitable for replanting
  because:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>underground services are too close to the tree pit area&nbsp;</li>
  <li>of changes in the immediate surroundings&nbsp;</li>
  <li>the area was originally not suitable for planting&nbsp;</li>
  <li>the tree was removed because of subsidence and&nbsp;the area is&nbsp;unsuitable for replanting a small&nbsp;tree.</li>
</ul>
