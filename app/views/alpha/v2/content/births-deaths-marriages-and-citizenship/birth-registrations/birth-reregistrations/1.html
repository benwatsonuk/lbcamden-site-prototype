<h2>Parents have married after the birth:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If the parents have married after the child was born and you want the natural father’s details to be on the birth
    record, you must re-register your child’s birth by completing <a
            href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/222508/dg_176556.pdf"
            class="link-external">Form LA1.</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Parents are not married:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If you want the father’s name on the birth record, both parents will need to fill in an <a href="#"
                                                                                                 class="link-external">application
      form to re-register a child’s birth</a> and return it to the Camden Register Office.
  </li>
  <li>If one of you can not be there, that person also needs to fill in a <a href="#" class="link-external">statutory
      declaration of parentage form.</a></li>
  <li>If the child is 16 years of age or over, you must get their written consent before their surname can be changed.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Apply for re-registration</h3>

<p>To apply for re-registration, <a href="#" class="link-external">please see the gov.uk website and download the
    appropriate form.</a></p>

<p>You should then complete the form and <a href="#" class="link-external">send it in to us</a> (rather than the General
  Register Office as is stated on some of the advice) together with any original documents required such as child’s
  existing birth certificate and (where applicable) marriage certificate (and, if in a foreign language, also a
  translation).</p>

<p>Once we receive your application we will book an appointment for you. In some cases it involves statutory
  declarations, foreign marriages or court orders we will have to refer to the General Register Office for approval
  which could take up to 6 weeks before an appointment can be made.</p>

<p>There is no charge for re-registrations, but if you would like a new birth certificate displaying the changes, you
  need to purchase one. See our fees list for current prices.</p>
