<h1>Protect your bike</h1>

<p>The cost of having your bicycle stolen or damaged in an attempted theft can run into
  hundreds of pounds. It is practical to take some basic precautions which can greatly minimise the risk of having
  your bike targeted by thieves.</p>

<h2>Hints and tips</h2>

<p>Buy a decent lock, preferably two if possible.</p>

<p>Before visiting a cycle shop please visit <a href="http://www.soldsecure.com" class="link-external">www.soldsecure.com</a>
  for information on certified locks. You should expect to pay £40 or more for a certified locking system.</p>

<h2>Locks are not for life</h2>

<p>Keep your security up to date and replace locks when they get old or rusty.</p>

<h2>Get insurance</h2>

<p>Check if your house insurance already covers your bicycle when away from home, and also whether the total value of
  the bike is covered.</p>

<p>If your bike is particularly valuable you may need to insure it separately.</p>

<h2>Security measures</h4>

  <p>Without a frame number the police don’t stand a chance of recovering your bike if it's stolen.</p>

  <p>Your bicycles frame number can normally be found underneath the bike, between the pedals or where the back wheel
    slots in.</p>

  <p>You can register your frame number with a scheme like: <a href="http://www.immobilise.com" class="link-external">www.immobilise.com</a>&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>Other methods of security tagging for identification include:&nbsp;</p>

            href="http://www.selectamark.co.uk" class="link-external">www.selectamark.co.uk</a></p>
  <p>It is advisable to do this at the point of purchasing your bike as&nbsp;you may&nbsp;never get around to it
    otherwise.</p>

  <h2>Lock your bike securely</h2>

  <p>Always lock the frame and both wheels to the stand or to a strong immovable object.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Make &nbsp;the lock and bike hard to manoeuvre when parked and do not allow thieves to place your lock(s) in
    contact with the ground.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p>
